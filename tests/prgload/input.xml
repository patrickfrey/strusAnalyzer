<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
   Computer hardware are the physical parts or components of a computer, such as the monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, graphic card,
   sound card and motherboard.[1] By contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and ran by hardware.
   Hardware is directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system.
