This is textcat 2.2 modified for strus in the following way:

 * change of name to avoid name clashes
 * renamed Makefile to Makefile.orig
 * added a textcatcli.cpp: simple command line tool detecting the
   language(s) of a file
 * fixed common.c:111:17: warning: implicit declaration of function
   ‘strdup’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
   char *result = strdup( s );
 * removed CVS directories
